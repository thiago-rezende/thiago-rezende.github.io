Hello everyone, in this post i'll describe a little about the [Ci Study](https://github.com/thiago-rezende/ci-study) project that's in my ``Git Hub``.

## This project is for what?
Just for study purposes

## How was it done?
The language that i've used was ``JavaScript``, with [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/). To run the unit tests, i used a package of [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org/) called [Jest](https://jestjs.io/).

For the [Continuous Integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_integration), i've used two services: [CircleCI](https://circleci.com) and [Travis CI](https://travis-ci.org/).

## Repo Structure
This repository is made up of two branches: [master](https://github.com/thiago-rezende/ci-study/tree/master) and [dev](https://github.com/thiago-rezende/ci-study/tree/dev).

#### Master Branch
The master branch is where the ``Release`` or passing build lives. This branch cannot receive commits directly, it needs to receive a merge from another branch that has passed in all the tests performed by the above-mentioned Continuous Integration services.

#### Dev Branch
The dev branch is where the ``Bleeding Edge`` code lives, also where development occurs.

## Workflow
The workflow of this project occurs in the following sequence:

- Commit in Dev branch.
- CI services run the checks.
- All checks have passed?
  - Yes: Can merge with Master.
  - No: Cannot merge with Master.
