Hello everyone, my name is `Thiago Rezende` i'm a student of Information Systems, ![](https://img.shields.io/badge/C++--orange.svg) developer and a enthusiast in game-engine development.

The main objective of this blog is to keep a post for each of my projects, each of these posts will describe the purpose and functionality of each project that i'm working on and also monitor their progress.

All my projects can have their progress and state visualized through the `badges` located at the beginning of each post and also in its own README.md provided by [shields.io][shields.io], the progress of the post can also be visualized in the same way, `see the next post for an example
`.

If necessary, `code snippets` will be added to facilitate the understanding and explanation of the project as in the example to ensure.

``` cpp
#include <iostream>

int main(int argc, char **argv)
{
  // -- your code goes here -- //
  return 0;
}
```
